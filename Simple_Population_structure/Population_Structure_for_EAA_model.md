# Population Structure
*Popluation Structure is a very important aspect of the genetics of populations, the basic premise is that individuals that are closer spatially are likley to be more closely related genetically. These analysis were pioneered in the 1940s and were defined by the correlation of reuiting gametes. As molecular markers became common, these analysis became easier to perform. These analysis are an essential first step before conducting either a genome-wide assocciation analysis or a genomic selection analysis as population sturcture can lead to false positives in these mixed model analysis.*

## Common Methods of Population Structure Analysis
(1) Principal Component Analysis
  - This is one of the fastest analysis that can be done. This is a classic dimentional reduction technique that takes as an input the numeric matrix of marker states, this   analysis requires that there is no missing data. 
(2) Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC)
(3) Admixture Analysis
(4) Structure Analysis
(5) Marker based Kinship Matrix
(6) Pedigree based Kinship Matirx
