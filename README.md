# Genome Enviroment Association Workshop
This is a series of lessons accompanied by scripts to conduct an Genome Environmental Association Analysis and Genomic Environmental Selection Analysis
1) Getting accession geolocation information and mapping accession location
2) Accessing climate and soil data 
3) Cleaning genomic data
4) Analysing population structure
5) Calculating LD decay
6) Performing the EAA (Environmental Association Analysis) & EAA (Environmental Association Analysis) Model Checking
7) Identifying candidate genomic regions and genes in LD with those regions
8) Perfomring the EGS (Environmental Genomic Selection)
