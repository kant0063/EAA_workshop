Identify database from where you will get geolocation data
-Custom Collection
This type of collection is new. It is developed for the specific set of experiments/analysis that are being done for the project.

- Germplasm Collection (e.g. GRIN-GLOBAL, Genesys-PGR)
Globally there are many germplasm collections. One of the largest is the USDA NPGS (United States Department of Agriculture National Plant Germplasm System). Many of the CGIAR (Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research). The NPGS online system has over 600,000 accessions that can be ordered for reseearch, the online portal is known as GRIN-GLOBAL (https://www.grin-global.org/). Another database of accessions is the Genesys (a platform developed by the FAO, Bioversity International, and the Secretatirat of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources, and the Crop Trust) which is an online platform that contains information about Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture -https://www.genesys-pgr.org/.

- Biogeographic Collection (e.g. GBIF)
A major source of information about wild species is GBIF (Globabl Biodiversity Inofrmation Facility - https://www.gbif.org/). This database holds over 100,000 datasets and contains nearly 3 billion records. These records all contain Geolocations which can then be used for different purposes.

- Herbarium Collection (e.g. Bishop Museum, NY Botanical Garden)
There are many museums that hold herbarium collections that have time and geolocation data. One example is the Bishop Museum (https://www.bishopmuseum.org/botany/),a collection that includes over 500,000 accessions of native and naturalized flora of the Hawaiian Islands. Another example is the NY botanical garden (https://sweetgum.nybg.org/science/) which has 4.5 million digitized specimans from around the world. 

All of these differnt types of collections have important information that can help identify the historic and contemporary locations of important germplasm.
