# Linkage Disequilibrium (LD)

*A measure of non-random association between segments of DNA (e.g. marker) at different physical positions on the chromosome in a given population*
**LD is a population parameter not a species parameter**
**LD is not constant across the genome, it is different in euchromatin, heterchromatin, near telomeres, near centromeres**
**It is better to calcualte local LD and chromosome scale LD rather than genome wide patterns**
